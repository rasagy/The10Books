###Supreeth Srinivasamurthy
1. Ruskin Bond: Collected Fiction 
My Mother got this for me from the Joseph's Library (where I spent many hours in my PU years). Devoured every story and novella from this collection many times over. One novella The Sensualist gave me many sleepless nights thanks to its overtly sexual themes. Possibly my first encounter with any sexual content in writing.
An Astrologers Day and other stories by R K Narayan
Rescued this from uncle's forgotten book collection where this and The Company of Women were the only two english books. It would be many months before I muster up the courage to *borrow* the Khushwant Singh Book. One short story Ishwar is particularly memorable. Its central themes are failure and suicide. I was in class 6. I still own this battered copy, easily the most prized possession in my little library.
2. Animorphs - K. A. Applegate
For the uninitiated this is a collection of novellas in which children turn into animals. I will never forget the one where this character turns into an eagle and rides the thermals.
Goosebumps - R.L.Stine
Not a huge horror fan now but back then this was heaven. Loved all the twists and turns and cheap scares. Clearly remember being very amused by this one story which ends with the souls of a brother and a sister getting interchanged. 
[HT Nivedita Sanju who was the source of all of these books for me]
3. 2001: A Space Odyssey - Arthur C Clarke 
This was my introduction to Sci-fi. Made me see the world in ways I didn't know it could exist. Also my first Blossoms buy.
The Complete Robot- Asimov
Strictly speaking this should just be I, Robot but what a trip the rest of the stories in this collection are. Robots are the coolest!
4. Midnight Children - Salman Rushdie
Funnily enough, this made me go back and find out my *origin story*. Then it gave me permission to twist and turn it to tell a good story. Indebted.
Portnoy's Complaint - Philip Roth
"Who is this Philip Roth? Who are these Jews and why are they so similar to conservative kannadiga families?"
5. The Long Tail - Chris Anderson 
Don’t Make Me Think - Steve Krug
Both of these introduced me to the internet and the broader themes, ideas and possibilities it offers. Used the former's ideas to solve an important problem at a previous workplace which still remains my biggest professional achievement.
6. Fermat's Last Theorem - Simon Singh
For a while in college I drifted away from fiction. I'm glad I did. This opened me up to James Gleick, Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan and many other science writers I spent hours reading and learning from.
Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid - Douglas Hofstadter
I read most of this sitting in my little room in Yadavanahalli over third year of engineering. Haven't read anything like it since. Still can't make any sense of the math parts. Can barely summarise the other parts.
7. High Fidelity - Nick Hornby 
Post college, movies had become my primary source of stories. Found my way back to fiction via John Cusack's whining. I'm happy I did.
Love is a Mix Tape - Rob Sheffield
Fragile and beautiful. I love it for the mixtapes and the heartbreak. Both of these books also introduced me to some great music. .
8. Blankets - Craig Thompson 
The art, the story and the characters have all left an indelible mark on me. Re-read it recently and went through all the feelings I experienced when I read it the first time.
the Scott Pilgrim series - Bryan O'Malley 
Even though I'm not a gamer I loved this because it broke so many conventions about what I thought comic books were. I too will always be in lesbians with Ramona Flowers.
[Thank you internet for access to these!]
9. Aunts Aren't Gentlemen 
I discovered Wodehouse rather late. A colleague at work gave this to me and boy had I missed out on hours of fun. Special mention to The Golf Omnibus which is the other memorable Wodehouse for me.
Reaper Man- Terry Pratchett 
Don’t think I’ll ever be able to adequately put the Discworld experience to words. Will never forget the mayfly passage that completely shattered my idea of nostalgia.
10. Video nights in Kathmandu - Pico Iyer
This sparked my enthusiasm for travel like no other book had up until then. Though it hasn’t held up over time, I love it for the ideas and the worlds it inspired me to see.
Into Thin Air - John Krakauer
In stark contrast to Video nights this book showcases the other side of travel adventure by chronicling the journey of arguably the worst mountaineering disaster in history. Chilling and inspiring at the same time.
